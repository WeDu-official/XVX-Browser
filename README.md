it's a very basic and minimal Browser that its creators don't track you

because we don't track anyone, the source code is open, and we didn't hide anything

that tracks people or anything like that.

note: this browser depends on duckduckgo search engine.

-THE NEW 1.4-U(Ultra) UPDATE FEATURES-

we added to the browser some features which allow to you to make a local host server and it can handle two users in the server to talk between each other with very strong system which doesn't allow to anyone after the two 
first users connection so any one after them can't join and even if they went out of the server they can't come
back they should open a new server and that is max level protection.
