# XVX Browser
it's a very basic and minimal Browser that its creators don't track you

because we don't track anyone, the source code is open, and we didn't hide anything 

that tracks people or anything like that.

note: this browser depends on duckduckgo search engine.

this browser contains:
1-history and deleting history
2-find in webpage
3-tab based (you can open multiple websites in multiple different tabs)
4-basic functions like reload, previous and forward
5-you can print the page
6-dev tools (Microsoft Edge devtools but don't worry 
they are open source and safe, so microsoft can't track you)
7-showing the source code of the page
8-you can zoom in and out

-THE NEW 1.1 UPDATE FEATURES-

1-under the url bar there is the website title bar
2-the literal mode which it's by defalut False but when you
