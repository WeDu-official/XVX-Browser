thanks for teepub(https://www.pinterest.com/teepub/) for the logo which it's found in
.jfif file format form, and it had been converted to .png file and the .png file format
was converted to .ico file format using file converting website, and we used
convertio(https://convertio.co/) as the website to convert file format into another types of
file formats
